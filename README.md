###React Weather app
Connected to weather API to render current weather using React

###General direction for building
1 load in everything from the react router module using es6 syntax
2 set the route in the ReactDOM.render and then start making individual routes
3 create our root path to route to the Main component (using {} to pass in the javascript expression)
4 add the alias to our webpack configuration
5 create the Nav component and load it to Main
6 create a Weather component and load it to the main app.jsx for routing
7 put the Weather component into the IndexRoute
8 now using this.props.children in Main will give us the Weather component
9 make an about component to render the about page
10 create route for the About component using Route and it will also be rendered as this.props.children in the Main component
11 create links by importing the Link function via the react-router module inside of the Nav component
12 add activeClassName to the links. change the link for Weather to IndexLink(need to pull from react-router) because it is matched with an IndexRoute
13 install axios for getting data from api
14 create an api folder to house the openWeatherMap.jsx
15 inside openWeatherMap.jsx declare a constant to hold the template for the request url
16 create module.exports for openWeatherMap to return an object with a function getTemp that takes the location and uses axios to return a promise
17 var encodedCity = encodeURIComponent(city) gets the correctly encoded location from the query string
18 wire up openWeatherMap.jsx to the Weather.jsx inside of the searchHandler
19 set isLoading state in Weather.jsx for the display temperature to better user experience 
20 About page is a good example of a stateless functional component because they only define the render method and has no state. we can easily refactor this with the arrow function from ES6
21 Refactor About, Example Nav WeatherMessage and Main

###Installing foundation and jQuery
npm install css-loader script-loader style-loader jquery foundation-sites --save-dev
style! for style loader | css! for css loader | script! for scriptloader

Inside webpack.config.js update the following: 
1 entry: ['script!jquery/dist/jquery.min.js', 'script!foundation-sites/dist/foundation.min.js', './app/app.jsx']
2 externals: {
  jquery: 'jQuery'
}
3 plugins: [
  new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
    '$': 'jquery',
    'jQuery': 'jquery'
  })
]
4 var webpack = require ('webpack');
5 load up foundation css in app.jsx
6 require('style!css!foundation-sites/dist/foundation.min.css') inside of app.jsx
7 $(document).foundation(); using jquery to call the foundation method
